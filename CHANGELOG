2019-08-10 Release 1.3.0

	What's that coming over the hill, is it a Gomacs, is it a Gomacs?

	It sure is, and at long last! After over a year since the last
	release, and giving us a nice round number at 256 commits, it's
	Gomacs 1.3.0!

	Features:
	* Transpose words and transpose chars with M-t and C-t
	* Shell commands have a much better interface now
	* Syntax highlighting for gbz80 and Inform 6
	* Auto-fill mode

	Bugfixes:
	* Crashes are rarer than ever ;)

	Tweaks:
	* Syntax improvements as compared to upstream
	* Fill-column behaves as it should now (fixed an off-by-one)
	* constant.specialChar entities are highlighted in yellow now
	* M-q is now fill-paragraph-or-region

	This will probably be the last big release to be tagged 1.*.*, as
	my problems with Gomacs now are of a wider scale. Let's look at
	some possible improvements for 2.0.0!

	* Zygomys for our Lisp again
	* Lisp features from GNU Emacs
	* Pasting tweaks (it's the last visual bug in Gomacs, but a tricky one)
	* Horizontal windows (which would require rewriting a lot of draw code!)

	I'm also thinking of release engineering here! The master branch
	should now be for releases only. I'll branch it off to a separate
	develop branch for those 2.0.0 tweaks (this means go-get should be
	much less risky, as you'll be getting one signed-off for release
	instead).

2018-07-07 Release 1.2.1

	Bugfix release - fix out-of-bounds on `goto-line`

2018-07-07 Release 1.2.0

	Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! It's Gomacs 1.2.0! This release is the
	biggest yet, and easily the most satisfied I've ever been with this
	weird side-project of mine.

	Features:
	* Mouse support
	* Syntax files extended and updated

	Bugfixes:
	* Allow empty files (fixing a crash)
	* Fix region weirdness (regions were fiddling with the undos)
	* Fix screen refreshing race condition
	* Fix highlighting breakage
	* Fix a divide-by-zero crash
	* Fix some crashes and edge-cases by removing a legacy feature (see
	  tweaks section below)

	Tweaks:
	* Disallow moving outside of the buffer - this is a weird Emacs quirk
	  that doesn't really suit Gomacs
	* Use uemacs-style scrolling (line-by-line) for long lines
	* `capitalize-word` now uses Lowercase â†’ Title
	* TODO comments now highlighted (in as distasteful a way as possible)

	Furthermore, for all you lisp-haters and sucklessers, there now exists a
	"lite" version of Gomacs! This version removes all Lisp support from the
	editor; reducing the binary size at the expense of Gomacs'
	extensibility. This leaves the bindings hard-coded in, though I'm sure
	you don't mind that ;) To try it for yourself, check-out and build the
	"lite" branch.

	Happy hacking!

2017-08-26 Release 1.1.0

	The release that should've been 1.0.0 - it's Gomacs 1.1.0!
	Featuring some important new features, bugfixes, and a ton of tweaks.

	Features:
	* Rectangles
	* Zmacs regions
	* `suspend-emacs` ported to all POSIX platforms

	Bugfixes:
	* Concurrent magic tricks to fix the "slow pasting" problem
	* Disable `terminal-title-mode` on non-Linux platforms
	* All actions can now be undone/redone in one go
	* Major mode and highlighting can change when file is saved/renamed
	* Re-write fill commands
	* Correct behaviour of `what-cursor`
	* Prevent region undos overwriting the clipboard

	Tweaks:
	* Re-highlight buffer after killing a region
	* Don't echo when inserting text
	* End-of-buffer tweaks
	* `apropos-command` tweaks
	* Lots of internal tweaks
